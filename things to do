* bugs
stop more than one login (implement server side and check to see if the socket has already received data)
force chat to scroll to bottom
make it easier to view 

* features
make images popup in lightbox, rather than new window
some info if no messages exist in the private chat (same for chatrooms? probs not)
add more tinymce plugins
